## Windows Installer

- Build script: `scripts/build-windows-release.ps1`
- Inno Setup definition: `installer/keyboard-wtf.iss`
- Website download: `site/downloads/keyboard-wtf-setup.exe`
- Public download: `https://keyboard-wtf.vercel.app/downloads/keyboard-wtf-setup.exe`

- SHA-256: `090A81F71788BBBFFCE1BD475EA34E7C1C071F1089CDEB27157F88A5D58FAF74`

The installer is self-contained and installs per user under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\keyboard.wtf`. It registers the installed executable under the current user's Windows Run key and launches the app after interactive installation.

The app downloads missing Vosk, Whisper, and Piper assets into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\keyboard.wtf` and retries incomplete setup on later launches.

## First Run

- New users default to `AlwaysAsk` for routine Jarvis actions.
- The local settings page opens at `Set API Key` when Gemini is not configured.
- `Get API Key` opens `https://aistudio.google.com/api-keys`.
- API keys are encrypted with Windows DPAPI and are never submitted to the website.
- The setup page reports Gemini, speech model, and Windows startup readiness.
- The setup page includes the default hotkeys and mode summary.
